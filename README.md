<h1 align="center">PiView - Self-hosted text document to pdf converter for Android</h1>

## Description
PiView is the Android client app for the Unoconv Web Service. Once the [Unoconv Web Service](https://github.com/SCOTT-HAMILTON/docker-unoconv-webservice) is installed on your own local server (such as a raspberrypi thus the name), you can launch this app, open Microsoft Word files or Libreoffice Documents and let them be converted to Pdfs and sent back to you.
